				<h3>Activity 1: Tell Me About Yourself</h3>
				<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>
				Good day! My name is Brent Millen P. Manzo, 19 years old residing at Taguig City. I stayed there with my family ever since I was born and had most of my experiences in that city. From pre-school to junior high school, I went there for school and only just now for college, I went to another city which is Makati.   						
				</p>
				<p>
				To explore a new place is something I really want to do always. I get to meet new people and make new friends. Most of my closest friends now come to the same college. Also, I was able to pursue my passion for dance in this college after getting in the school's official dance varsity. From then, I started participating in trainings inside and outside the team.  	
				</p>
				<p>
				Over the summer, I had workshops and performed in a recital. The team also gave me the chance to teach for the first time in an open class. It was a great summer experience for me as I was able to improve in my passion and share what I know as well. It was fulfilling for me and I will certainly do it again given the chance.	
				</p>
				<p>
				Knowing that the subject title has something to do with design and user interface, I expect to learn how to effectively make a design for programs that will allow me to efficiently make interactions with users. I am really excited for what is up for us in this subject because this appeals as something new for me in my chosen course.

				<h3>Activity 2: Favorite App</h3>
				<h5>Shazam</h5>
				
				<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
				<p>
				Shazam is an app that allows you to identify music with the press of a button. It records the song playing and then gives you all the details about the song including the artist, album and year released. 
				</p>
				<img class="img-circle" src="assets/img/shazam-logo.png">
				<p>
				I found this really convenient because I am able to know immediately some songs that have inaudible lyrics or those that plays for just a short time. As a dancer, I often catch vibes with some songs in public such as in restaurants, coffee shops, groceries and other places which plays some music.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Other App Features</dt>
					<dd>- Preview songs with Apple Music and add them to Apple Music and Spotify playlists</dd>
					<dd>- View music lyrics and YouTube videos for the songs you Shazam</dd>
					<dd>- Auto Shazam can recognize songs in the background after you've left the app</dd>
					<dd>- Visual recognition also works as a code reader for all QR codes</dd>
					<dd>and many other more cool features!</dd>

				<h3>Activity 3: How would you design an interface for a 1000 floor elevator?</h3>    
				<dl>
					<dt>Layout</dt>
					<dd>- provide a keypad for numbers from 0-9 </dd>
					<dd>- small display screen</dd>
					<dd><p>
						Upon entering the elevator, the user will simply type the floor destination using the numbers and will be ask to confirm afterwards. The floor number entered will then be displayed on the side so that others passengers may see the stops of the elevator. For instance, a passenger enters a floor nearer than the first queued, it will be put as stop before the first one. In short, it will prioritized floors according to level, depending on whether it is going up or down, and not by first queued floor.

				<h3>Activity 4: Needfinding</h3>
				<p>
					Problem: Smartphones tend to be distractive while learning because of the connectivity it offers. The presence of smartphones affect the productivity of users as one tries to check notifications to stay connected from time to time.
